          <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
          <h6>Where is the competition held?</h6>
          <p style="margin-left:20px">The Towne Building of Penn Engineering, located at 220 S. 33rd St, Philadelphia, PA</p>
          <h6>Will there be food?</h6>
          <p style="margin-left:20px">Yes! We provide free pizza for lunch and also offer concessions.</p>
          <h6>Does an adult need to come?</h6>
          <p style="margin-left:20px">We ask that each school has an adult chaperone. That person doesn't need to be a teacher - it can be a parent or other involved person - but we need someone to be responsible for getting everyone here and then back home. Please email us if this would be an issue; we've made exceptions for special cases in the past. </p>
          <h6>How many people should I bring?</h6>
          <p style="margin-left:20px">At least two; teams should be at least two people, but are generally four. Most schools bring 1-3 teams, but many also bring 5 or 6. If you're thinking about bringing more than 6 teams, please email us so we can discuss it. </p>
